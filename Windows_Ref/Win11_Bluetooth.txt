Check if the microphone is enabled in the Bluetooth settings:

    Press Windows key + I to open the Settings app.
    Go to "Devices" > "Bluetooth & other devices".
    Click on your Bluetooth headset and then click on "Device properties".
    Make sure the "Input" option is turned on.

Also, Check if the microphone is enabled in the privacy settings:

    Press Windows key + I to open the Settings app.
    Go to "Privacy" > "Microphone".
    Make sure the "Allow apps to access your microphone" option is turned on.
