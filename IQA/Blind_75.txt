For me personally, blind 75 was enough for getting all the core patterns. The next limiting factors for me were
    - problems with very niche solutions that you'd only get if you've already seen them before
    - speed since you may have to answer multiple problems in a single interview
Do the blind 75 thoroughly to understand all the patterns, then start timing yourself to determine if you need to get faster. I'm currently shooting for consistent 15 minute solutions so I'm still on the grind.
