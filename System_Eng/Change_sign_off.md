* The Three-Phase Contribution Review<br/>
https://sage.thesharps.us/2014/09/01/the-gentle-art-of-patch-review/<br/>

Sarah Sharp\-- <br/>
Instead of putting off reviewing first-time contributions
and thoroughly reviewing everything in the contribution at once, I
propose a three-phase review process for maintainers:

1. Is the idea behind the contribution sound? <br/>
2. Is the contribution architected correctly? <br/>
3. Is the contribution polished? <br/>

You can compare these contribution review phases to the phases of
building a new house or taking on a remodeling project. The first phase
is a simple yes or no on the architectural diagram, the big idea of the
contribution. The second phase is getting all the structural issues
correct and making sure the plumbing and electrical all connect
properly. The third phase is making everything polished, sanding off the
rough corners, and slapping on a coat of paint to match whatever color
the bike shed is currently painted.

=\> idea, architecture, polish (iap)
